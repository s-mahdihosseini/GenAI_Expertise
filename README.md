**Generative AI, Expertise, and Effective Labor Supply**
**Public Data Release**

This repository contains the task-level and occupation-level datasets underlying the paper:

Generative AI, Expertise, and Effective Labor Supply Seyed M. Hosseini and Guy Lichtinger (2026)

The data are constructed from O*NET task descriptions combined with large language model (LLM) evaluations. We distinguish between the extensive margin of automation (task removal) and the intensive margin (task simplification/augmentation). The data allow researchers to construct the Potential Supply Shift (PSS) index, which measures how GenAI alters the share of the workforce qualified to perform specific occupations.

**1. Task-Level Dataset**

File: Final_Task_Dataset.xlsx Unit of Observation: Unique O*NET Task (N=19,265)

This dataset contains the primitive LLM evaluations for every task in the O*NET database.


**Identification & Weights**

OccupationTitle: O*NET occupation title.

ONETSOCCode: 8-digit O*NET-SOC code.

TaskID: Unique O*NET task identifier.

Task: Full text description of the task.

TaskType: Classification as "Core" or "Supplemental".

task_weight: Weight used for aggregation (1.0 for Core tasks, 0.5 for Supplemental).

task_importance_score: O*NET Importance rating (1–5 scale).

task_frequency_annual: Estimated annual frequency of the task. Derived from O*NET categorical frequency ratings (1–7) converted into annual counts (e.g., "Hourly" ≈ 2080).

**Automation & Exposure Measures**

automation_eloun: Original GPT-4 rating from Eloundou et al. (2024).

automation_hl: Updated automation rating (T0–T4) using the authors' rubric and ChatGPT-5.2 (current Dec 2025 capabilities).

beta: Exposure intensity used for productivity calculations (1 if exposed to LLM, 0.5 if exposed to LLM+Software, 0 otherwise).

auto_hl_bi: Binary indicator (1 if task is T3 or T4, >80% automatable) based on the authors' updated measure.

**Expertise Measures (Task Complexity)**

expertise_without: Baseline expertise score (1–5) required to perform the task without AI. (Model: ChatGPT-5.2).

expertise_with: Counterfactual expertise score (1–5) required to perform the task with a GenAI assistant.

mmwo_without: Baseline training time in months (median mapping of expertise_without score).

mmwo_with: Counterfactual training time in months (median mapping of expertise_with score).

**Validation Variables**

expertise_without_claude: Baseline expertise score generated by Claude Haiku 4.5.

expertise_without_llama: Baseline expertise score generated by Llama 3.3 70B.

mmwo_without_claude: Training months implied by Claude ratings.

mmwo_without_llama: Training months implied by Llama ratings.

**2. Occupation-Level Dataset**

File: Final_Occupation_Dataset.xlsx Unit of Observation: O*NET Occupation (N=923)

This dataset aggregates task-level data to the occupation level to provide indices on exposure, expertise shifts, and potential supply shifts.

**Identification & Labor Market Controls**

occupation_title: Occupation name.

onetsoccode: O*NET-SOC code.

total_employment_2024: Total employment (BLS OEWS May 2024).

employment_share_2024: Share of total US employment.

mean_annual_wage_2024: Mean annual wage (BLS OEWS May 2024).

median_annual_wage_2024: Median annual wage (BLS OEWS May 2024).

avg_years_schooling: Weighted average years of schooling required (derived from O*NET).

avg_experience_years: Weighted average years of related work experience required (derived from O*NET).

**Automation Exposure**

avg_auto_hl_bi: Headline Exposure Measure. Share of tasks within the occupation classified as automatable (T3/T4) by the authors' updated rubric.

auto_hl_bi: Binary indicator or raw aggregation of the HL automation measure.

**Occupational Expertise (Training Months)**

avg_mmwo_without: Baseline Occupational Expertise based on the mmwo_without variable from the task dataset.

avg_mmwo_extensive: Average expertise of the remaining tasks after automating/removing exposed tasks.

avg_mmwo_intensive: Average expertise of tasks assuming workers have access to GenAI assitance (task simplification).

avg_mmwo_combined: Post-AI Expertise. Final average expertise requirement accounting for both task removal (extensive) and simplification (intensive).

expertise_percentile: The occupation's percentile rank in the baseline expertise distribution (1−ps_without).

**Potential Expertise Shift (PES)**

pes_extensive_mmwo: Change in average training months due to task automation/removal.

pes_intensive_mmwo: Change in average training months due to task augmentation/simplification.

pes_combined_mmwo: Total PES. The net change in required training months (mapped).

**Potential Supply Shift (PSS)**

ps_without: Share of the workforce qualified to perform the job at baseline.

ps_with: Share of the workforce qualified to perform the job post-AI.

pss: Potential Supply Shift. The increase in the share of the workforce qualified to perform the occupation.


**Productivity Measures**

ai_exposure_share: Share of the occupation's total "Work Volume" exposed to GenAI. Work volume is calculated as ∑(Frequency×Importance).

pred_productivity_effect: Predicted Productivity Gain. Calculated as ai_exposure_share × 0.5. Represents the aggregate labor time savings assuming GenAI reduces time on exposed tasks by 50%.

**Validation**

avg_mmwo_without_claude: Baseline expertise (months) using Claude ratings.

avg_mmwo_without_llama: Baseline expertise (months) using Llama ratings.

**Methodology Summary**

Task Scoring: We used ChatGPT-5.2 to score all O*NET tasks on (a) Automation feasibility and (b) Expertise requirements (1-5 scale) with and without AI assistance.

Mapping to Months: Ordinal expertise scores were mapped to continuous "months of training" using a separate LLM prompt and median aggregation.

Aggregation: Task-level data were aggregated to occupations using O*NET task weights (Core=1, Supplemental=0.5).

Productivity: Unlike standard exposure measures, the productivity variable weighs tasks by their frequency and importance to capture the volume of work affected, not just the count of tasks.

PSS Calculation: We estimate the distribution of workforce expertise F(e) using the employment-weighted distribution of occupational requirements. PSS represents the mass of workers between the old expertise threshold and the new (lower) post-AI threshold.
